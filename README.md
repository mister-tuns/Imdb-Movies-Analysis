# Imdb-Movies-Analysis
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). The objective of this project was to explore the dataset and identify areas for further investigation and exploration
### Questions for Analysis

> Which production company produced the popular movies

> Which genres are the most popular from year to year

> Which genres earned the most revenue from year to year

> Whether high budget movies earn more revenue that lower budget movies 
> ## Conclusions

> This analysis attempted to answer all of the questions raised at the beginning of this analysis. 

Universal pictures appear to be most involved in the production of movies hence are most popular. However, it is important to note that only the main production company for each movie were considered during this analysis as others were dropped

Going by the popularity ratings, Sci-fi movies had the highest popularity ratings on average. However it is important to note that i could have also used the count of each movie genre( frequency of appearances in the dataset) to come to a conclusion instead of using the mean of the popularity rating for each movie genre.

Action movies generated the most revenue. However, a lot of rows were dropped at the beginning of this analysis that included movies with budget and revenue equals to zero. These could have been to due to some error as the number of rows(movies) with zero budget and revenue were a lot.

There is a strong positive correlation between budget and revenue. However further tests, through the use of inferential statistics may be neccessary to arrive at a suitable conclusion.

## Limitations

1. About 70% of the original dataset were dropped as a result of zero values being recorded for budget and revenue for some entries. These rows were not useful in answering the questions posed at the beginning of this analysis.
2. Inferential statistics were not computed to gain further insights and make predictions based on the data. There is room for further analysis in this area.
